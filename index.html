          <p>
            I am a 5th-year BS-MS student in Physics at IISER Bhopal, India. My academic interests include theoretical high-energy physics, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology. I come from Bihar, a state in eastern India known for its rich history and deep philosophical traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not working on a physics problem, I enjoy reading philosophical books, noticing things around me, and playing basketball and table tennis. I’m also fascinated by how ideas evolve—whether in science, society, or individual minds.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pathology in quantum field theories:</strong> My broader research interests center around the formulation of quantum field theories, with a particular emphasis on self-interacting vector field theories and their massless limit — the subject of my master's thesis. In addition to this, I have been exploring aspects of general relativity and theoretical frameworks that aim to unify gravity with quantum mechanics. </p>
        <p><strong>Master's Thesis:</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eZwrV5wcmt-omyjIRBcIUQgv2WGOIxqH/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Self-intracting massive vector fields and its massless limit</a></li>
        <p><strong>Preprint:</strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22119" target="_blank">arXiv:2505.22119</a></p>
        <li><strong>Ongoing Study:</strong> I am also deeply interested in quantum cosmology. Currently, I am studying quantum information flow in open systems using the influence functional formalism, aiming to model observer-centric dynamics. This line of inquiry is driven by a fundamental question: What does the universe look like to a local observer?.</li>

      <h2>Previous projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
  <strong>High-Harmonic Generation in Confined Hydrogen Atoms:</strong>
  This project focuses on obtaining accurate results for hydrogen-like atoms under intense external fields. We employ a non-perturbative framework to simulate the generation of high-order harmonics induced by ultrashort, intense pulsed laser fields. Our numerical implementation is based on the Split Operator Method combined with a generalized pseudospectral approach, which effectively handles the Coulomb singularity and semi-infinite domain problems. This method was originally developed by 
  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010497000633" target="_blank">Shih-I Chu et al. (1996)</a>.
  We uses this technique to predict the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of endohedrally confined hydrogen atoms — specifically, hydrogen atoms trapped within C<sub>60</sub> cages — and compared these results with the spectra of free (unconfined) hydrogen atoms.

<li>
  <strong>Dessins d’Enfants and Galois Orbit Prediction:</strong>
  This was my first experience working with abstract mathematical structures like <em>dessins d’enfants</em>. I began by studying foundational topics including Riemann surfaces, Belyi maps, dessins, and Galois actions. I then explored a dataset of dessins in multiple representations — namely, the matrix form and the cyclic edge list form. 
  My analysis started with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate the intrinsic (true) dimension of the dataset. Finally, I trained a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict the Galois orbit size of each dessin.

      <h2>Notes/Useful links</h2>
      <p>Coming soon —  This section contains my personal notes, study references, and links to literature, papers, or resources that I find insightful — spanning topics in physics, philosophy, and beyond. I’ll be updating this space regularly with content that has helped shape my academic thinking and curiosity.
